Documentation is stored in the `llm-docs` directory. Please review all the contents of that directory thoroughly and use the information to inform your responses.

- The SvelteKit documentation is at `llm-docs/svelte-docs-full.txt`.
- The WPGraphQL documentation is in the `llm-docs/wpgraphql-docs` directory.
- The WPGraphQL for ACF documentation is in the `llm-docs/wpgraphql-for-acf` directory.
- I ran the GraphQL introspection query in `llm-docs/introspection-query.graphql` and saved the result in `llm-docs/introspection-result.json`. By reviewing this, you can understand the GraphQL schema of the headless WordPress site.
