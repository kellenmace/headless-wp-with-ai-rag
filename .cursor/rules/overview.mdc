This project is a SvelteKit application that sources its data from a headless WordPress site running at http://headless-wp.local. Data is accessed via the site's GraphQL endpoint: http://headless-wp.local/graphql.

The headless WordPress site is configured with the following plugins:
- WPGraphQL
- Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
- WPGraphQL for ACF

These plugins enable advanced custom data structures in WordPress to be queried from the SvelteKit frontend using GraphQL.
